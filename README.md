Your 24/7 AI Guardian for DeFi Investments on Celo
JARVIS monitors your crypto portfolio in real-time, detects risks using AI, and takes autonomous action with your permission to protect your assets.


üéØ Problem Statement
DeFi investors face critical challenges:

Rug Pulls & Exploits: $3.8B lost to DeFi hacks in 2023 alone
Impermanent Loss: LP providers lose money silently due to price volatility
24/7 Monitoring Burden: Markets never sleep, but investors must
Complexity: Manual risk analysis requires deep technical knowledge
Slow Response: By the time you notice a problem, it's often too late

JARVIS solves this by being your autonomous AI guardian that never sleeps.

üí° Solution Overview
JARVIS is an AI-powered monitoring system that:

Watches your wallets and liquidity pools 24/7
Analyzes risks using GPT-4 AI models
Alerts you instantly via phone call AND Telegram
Recommends specific actions to protect your funds
Executes protective measures with your permission

Key Innovation: Human-in-the-Loop AI Autonomy
JARVIS uses AI to make decisions but requires human approval before execution, combining the best of automation and human judgment.

Risk Detection

TVL Drops: Detects sudden liquidity exits (potential rug pulls)
Reserve Imbalances: Identifies abnormal pool ratios
Portfolio Losses: Tracks value drops and impermanent loss
Custom Thresholds: Configurable sensitivity levels

AI Decision Making

python# JARVIS AI Flow


Context = {
    "alert": "TVL dropped 25%",
    "severity": "CRITICAL",
    "pool": "0x1e59...",
    "user_position": "$5,000"
}

AI Analysis ‚ûú {
    "action": "Remove Liquidity",

üì± Demo Scenarios
Scenario 1: Rug Pull Prevention
1. Pool TVL drops 30% in 5 minutes
2. JARVIS detects anomaly
3. AI recommends: "Remove all liquidity immediately"
4. Phone call + Telegram alert sent
5. User clicks "Yes, Execute"
6. JARVIS removes liquidity to safety
7. User saved from 80% loss
Scenario 2: Impermanent Loss Alert
1. LP position loses 15% value
2. JARVIS calculates IL impact
3. AI recommends: "Rebalance to stablecoin"
4. User receives notification
5. User reviews and approves
6. Position protected from further loss
